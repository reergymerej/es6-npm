# es6-npm

ES6 is addicting and I don't want to stop when it's time to write an npm module.

## Installation

Clone this and then `npm install`.

## Terminal, Shmerminal

Stay in ST3 by creating a "gulp" build system.  Manage everything through the gulpfile.js, but watch the results in the editor.
```json
{
    "shell_cmd": "gulp",
}
```

## TODO

* add watch task for gulp
* explain the prepublish script
